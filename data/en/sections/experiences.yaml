    overview: In affiliation with MSP's while providing consultation for private clients. This included architecting enterprise networks, deploying complex sets of integrated software utilities, and automating internal operations. I also maintained, secured, and audited existing infrastructures, networks, and applications. These clients ranged from teams of 5 to campuses and offices with 500+ employees. I personally worked with Windows, Unix, and MacOS network environments in addition to engineering custom implementations for each client's workflow. I take pride in this experience learning from many different fast paced industries, especially my work supporting homes and programs for people getting help with substance addictions. Many of my clients were schools and churches that required the highest levels of security, privacy, and end user experience. During this time, I secured, automated, and supported 100+ companies and their networks. I still help a few clients with specific tasks or projects when they reach out from time to time.

    name: Staminus / StackPath

    location: Irvine, CA
    overview: "Staminus was a global provider of cyber security through hybrid DDoS mitigation service utilizing cloud and on-premises hardware appliances. I architected and engineered several aspects of the network, maintained and added to existing appliance softwares, provided enterprise customers with support, and built custom implementations for companies such as Advania, Huawei, and Neverfail. I regularly worked with PHP, and spent a lot of time with Juniper and Cisco hardware. A lot of my experience involved making live fixes and security implementations while under high pressure.  \n
    &nbsp; Some things I used and performed from day to day were:  \n
    * Onboarding all enterprise customers  \n
    * Managing a team of 2 operations support techs  \n
    * Maintaining our proprietary security software in C/HHVM  \n
    * Developing Traffic Monitoring application bug fixes and new features in HHVM/PHP5  \n
    * Automating all internal processes and hardware deployments through Ansible  \n
    * Live swings and nulls of routes as appropriate for high value customers' DDoS mitigation  \n
    * Creating/maintaining the user/admin panel flow and features  \n
    * Provisioning and maintaining rDNS/Proxy for customers  \n
    * Maintaining and monitoring AC/PDU/UPS/Generators  \n
    * Installing, configuring, and troubleshooting high end Cisco and Juniper equipment  \n
    * Developing client and server applications using PHP/Bash/Python/Scala/Go/Inline C/VTYSH  \n
    * Configuring BGP, tunnels, and routes for most customers and internal operations  \n
    * Managing internal operations/IT such as printers, phones, etc. across multiple teams  \n

    &nbsp; I was also the main tech for trips to One Wilshire DataCenter for maintenance and emergency fixes at our PoP there. During the acquisition process, I met with stakeholders from other companies for planning and technical discussion, commonly travelling to the MaxCDN office in LA, as well as attending/representing at trade shows and events such as NANOG.  \n
    &nbsp; Intreppid was Staminus's child company designed for renting out unused dedicated machine space in our datacenter. The website and panel were run using WHMCS. The operations team I managed also handled tickets and support for Intreppid. I engineered backend software for automation and deployments. I also maintained and added features weekly to our in house ticketing system and staff portal. (Most technical operations were performed through the staff/admin panel, which was designed and operated in Smarty/PHP and hooked directly into the API I implemented to control the backend aspects of the network (PHP/C/Bash).  \n
    &nbsp; Staminus has developed and currently maintains its own global patented scrubbing technology, scrubbing centers, and network backbone across the world.  \n
    &nbsp; Staminus was acquired in 2016 for 12x revenue by StackPath, a global cyber security firm with nearly $200M in funding. After this, I worked with Atlassian tools and gained more experience working on networks designed for CDN, VPN, DNS, and application layer security."
